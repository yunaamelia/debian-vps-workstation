# Insight Capture

**Trigger:** A response reveals sudden synthesis, reframing, or non-obvious implications. Your own reasoning derives a structural insight, reveals a prior assumption was wrong, or catches a sloppy habit worth preventing.

**Goal:** Capture the insight before it's lost to the session ether.

---

## When This Fires

You (the AI) should suggest invoking this when:
- 🎯 A response reveals a sudden synthesis or reframing
- 🎯 Reasoning derives a non-obvious structural insight
- 🎯 A prior assumption turns out to be wrong
- 🎯 A non-obvious implication emerges from the work
- 🎯 A pattern clicks that wasn't explicit before
- 🎯 You catch yourself about to make a common AI mistake
- 🎯 You notice a sloppy habit that could become a rule to prevent it

## Capture Flow

### Step 1: Acknowledge
Pause. Say: "That's interesting - should I capture this insight?"

### Step 2: Quick Classification
- **Synthesis** → Connected dots that weren't obvious
- **Reframe** → Shifted how to think about the problem
- **Correction** → Prior assumption was wrong
- **Pattern** → Could become a rule
- **System insight** → Reveals how things actually work
- **Sloppy habit** → AI tendency that causes problems (prime rule candidate!)

### Step 3: Capture Location

| Size | Where | Format |
|------|-------|--------|
| One-liner | SCRATCHPAD.md → Insights section | `- 💡 [DATE] Description` |
| Paragraph | SCRATCHPAD + brief reference | `- 💡 [DATE] Brief. Details below.` |
| Full write-up | notes/DISCOVERY-*.md | Then reference in SCRATCHPAD |

### Step 4: Rule Potential Check
Ask: "Could this become a rule?"
- If yes → Add to SCRATCHPAD → Proposed Rules section
- If no → Just the insight capture is enough

## Example Captures

### Quick Insight (SCRATCHPAD only)
```markdown
- 💡 [2025-01-15] Firebase timestamps need serverTimestamp() not new Date() for consistency
```

### With Details (SCRATCHPAD + note)
```markdown
- 💡 [2025-01-15] Event listeners on dynamic elements need delegation pattern. See notes/DISCOVERY-event-delegation.md
```

### Rule Proposal (SCRATCHPAD)
```markdown
- 📋 [2025-01-15] Delegation pattern for dynamic elements → notes/PROPOSED-event-delegation-rule.md
```

## Backup Trigger

If the AI doesn't catch it, user can say:
- "Capture this"
- "That's a gotcha"
- "We should remember this"
- "Future me needs to know this"

Any of these should trigger this workflow.
